Hey, I'm Ken!
I primarily learned how to write code using Skript, a Minecraft coding language. With the goofing around I did as a kid I can now write "decent" python files.
I'm still learning and I know I have a lot to learn; I plan on learning Java, a bit of web development, and machine learning on Python!

Thanks for stopping by!
